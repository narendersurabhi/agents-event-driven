### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Acentra Health – Okemos, MI**
**Senior Machine Learning Engineer & AI Solutions Architect** | Dec 2016 – Present

* AI/ML lead for Medicaid integrity and care-management products (**Program Intelligence, AuditStudio, ClaimsSure, Provider Risk Scoring, Patient Risk Scoring**), owning architecture, implementation, and productionization of ML and GenAI capabilities.
* Designed and deployed LLM-powered features on AWS Bedrock (RAG + vector search) to auto-generate human-readable fraud, provider risk, and patient risk narratives—reducing reviewer investigation time and improving coverage of high-impact cases.
* Built agentic AI workflows (LangGraph + Bedrock) that orchestrate multi-step fraud pattern discovery, data retrieval, and explanation generation, uncovering emerging FWA schemes and risk patterns beyond static rules.
* Engineered HIPAA-compliant ML pipelines on SageMaker & Glue (PySpark) **processing 116M+ Medicaid claims annually** with automated feature extraction, MLflow-based experiment tracking, and governed deployments to batch and real-time endpoints.
* Operationalized supervised & unsupervised models for **pre-pay and post-pay FWA detection, provider-level risk scoring, and patient-level risk stratification**, integrating scores into SIU, audit, and care-management workflows.
* Implemented monitoring for drift, bias, and performance using SageMaker Clarify and custom dashboards; defined SLOs and alerts to keep accuracy, latency, and coverage within target ranges.
* Collaborated with product, engineering, clinical/care, and compliance teams to design robust APIs and data contracts exposing scores, risk tiers, and GenAI explanations to downstream systems.
* Mentored engineers and analysts on GenAI, MLOps, Python best practices, and experimentation; influenced AI roadmap, standards, and governance.

**Selected Projects**

* **Medicaid Patient Risk Scoring – Proactive Outreach & Care Management**

  * Designed a patient risk scoring solution to identify high-risk Medicaid members needing timely outreach (e.g., avoidable admissions, disease progression, care gaps).
  * Engineered features from claims history, utilization patterns, chronic condition markers, demographics, and gaps in care to stratify members into actionable risk tiers.
  * Deployed on SageMaker with Glue-based feature pipelines and Redshift/S3 data marts, delivering ranked member lists and model explanations to state outreach and care-management teams.

* **Medicaid Provider Risk Scoring – Network Integrity & FWA Prevention**

  * Built a provider risk scoring engine aggregating claim-level, member-level, and peer-comparison features into unified risk scores for individual providers and groups.
  * Captured billing patterns, procedure mix, patient demographics, temporal trends, and peer outliers to distinguish high-risk behavior from legitimate practice variation.
  * Deployed on SageMaker with Glue/Redshift/S3 pipelines and integrated scores into Program Intelligence and SIU workflows for targeted investigations.

* **Program Intelligence – AI-First FWA Detection Platform**

  * Architected an analytics platform combining supervised models, unsupervised pattern mining, network analysis, and LLM-based narratives to detect fraud, waste, and abuse across large Medicaid populations.
  * Modeled complex interactions across members, providers, procedures, and time; used geospatial and network features to identify collusion and regional anomalies.

* **AuditStudio (North Dakota) – Post-Pay Audit Scoring**

  * Designed unsupervised ML pipelines using PCA and KMeans to score claims and providers for audit prioritization, increasing precision and scalability of post-pay audits.
  * Built Glue PySpark ETL and Redshift/S3 integrations to deliver prioritized audit lists and detailed features on consistent cadences to state reviewers.

* **ClaimsSure – Real-Time Pre-Pay FWA Detection**

  * Developed and deployed pre-pay fraud scoring models (logistic regression + scenario/rule-based logic) to flag high-risk claims prior to payment, increasing savings and reducing downstream audit load.
  * Designed end-to-end integration: input validation, scoring APIs, thresholds and overrides, monitoring of latency and accuracy in production.
