        "AI/ML lead for Medicaid integrity and care-management products (Program Intelligence, AuditStudio, ClaimsSure, Provider Risk Scoring, Patient Risk Scoring), owning architecture, implementation, and productionization of ML and GenAI capabilities.",
        "Designed and deployed LLM-powered features on AWS Bedrock (RAG + vector search) to auto-generate human-readable fraud, provider risk, and patient risk narratives—reducing reviewer investigation time and improving coverage of high-impact cases.",
        "Built agentic AI workflows (LangGraph + Bedrock) that orchestrate multi-step fraud pattern discovery, data retrieval, and explanation generation, uncovering emerging FWA schemes and risk patterns beyond static rules.",
        "Engineered HIPAA-compliant ML pipelines on SageMaker & Glue (PySpark) processing 116M+ Medicaid claims annually with automated feature extraction, MLflow-based experiment tracking, and governed deployments to batch and real-time endpoints.",
        "Operationalized supervised & unsupervised models for pre-pay and post-pay FWA detection, provider-level risk scoring, and patient-level risk stratification, integrating scores into SIU, audit, and care-management workflows.",
        "Implemented monitoring for drift, bias, and performance using SageMaker Clarify and custom dashboards; defined SLOs and alerts to keep accuracy, latency, and coverage within target ranges.",
        "Collaborated with product, engineering, clinical/care, and compliance teams to design robust APIs and data contracts exposing scores, risk tiers, and GenAI explanations to downstream systems.",
        "Mentored engineers and analysts on GenAI, MLOps, Python best practices, and experimentation; influenced AI roadmap, standards, and governance.",
        "Designed a patient risk scoring solution to identify high-risk Medicaid members needing timely outreach (e.g., avoidable admissions, disease progression, care gaps).",
        "Engineered features from claims history, utilization patterns, chronic condition markers, demographics, and gaps in care to stratify members into actionable risk tiers.",
        "Deployed on SageMaker with Glue-based feature pipelines and Redshift/S3 data marts, delivering ranked member lists and model explanations to state outreach and care-management teams.",
        "Built a provider risk scoring engine aggregating claim-level, member-level, and peer-comparison features into unified risk scores for individual providers and groups.",
        "Architected an analytics platform combining supervised models, unsupervised pattern mining, network analysis, and LLM-based narratives to detect fraud, waste, and abuse across large Medicaid populations.",
        "Designed unsupervised ML pipelines using PCA and KMeans to score claims and providers for audit prioritization, increasing precision and scalability of post-pay audits.",
        "Developed and deployed pre-pay fraud scoring models (logistic regression + scenario/rule-based logic) to flag high-risk claims prior to payment, increasing savings and reducing downstream audit load."
