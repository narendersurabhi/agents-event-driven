    "body": "With 15+ years in software engineering and 8+ years building production ML and Generative AI, I design agentic systems that are reliable, observable, and cost-efficient at scale. I’m excited by the opportunity to advance Avalara’s AI platform with pragmatic, production-first engineering that balances speed, safety, and robustness.\n\nMy background aligns closely with your needs: I’ve built agentic workflows with LangGraph/LangChain and implemented both MCP (authoring Python MCP servers/clients with scoped permissions and auditability) and an A2A protocol for cross‑agent collaboration (capability discovery, mTLS/JWT handshakes, JSON schemas, Kafka mailboxes). I’ve operationalized LLM applications using GPT‑4/4o, Claude 3.5 via Bedrock, and Llama 3 with RAG (FAISS/Chroma), guardrails, and custom evaluation. On the platform side, I’ve delivered AWS-first solutions (SageMaker, Bedrock, Glue, Redshift, S3, Lambda/EKS) with CI/CD pipelines (pytest unit/functional tests, 85%+ coverage, SonarQube gates), distributed systems patterns, and SLO/SLA-driven operations.\n\nRecent impact includes: achieving 99.9%+ uptime and p95 <450 ms at 1.2k RPS for online scoring; improving reviewer throughput by 32% with RAG-powered LLM narratives; and increasing agentic task completion by 21% via planner–executor–critic workflows integrated through MCP/A2A. I also led reliability initiatives—multi‑region DR (RTO 30 min/RPO 5 min) and incident reduction by 40% YoY—while mentoring engineers, leading code/design reviews, and authoring runbooks and knowledge base articles.\n\nI’d welcome the chance to discuss how these experiences—especially building enterprise-grade agentic systems, LLMOps, and HA platforms—can accelerate Avalara’s roadmap. Thank you for your time; I’m available at your convenience for a conversation."
