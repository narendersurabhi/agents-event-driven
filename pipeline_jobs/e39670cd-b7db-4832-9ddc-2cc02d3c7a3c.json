    "body": "I’m a senior ML engineer with 8+ years building and operating production ML platforms and applications at scale. I’m drawn to Samsara’s real-time, high-availability challenges and believe my background in low-latency serving, streaming data, and MLOps would add immediate value.\n\nI’ve owned end-to-end delivery from data ingestion and feature stores through training, deployment, and monitoring on AWS (SageMaker, EKS, Glue/Spark). I build both real-time and batch inference with CI/CD, model registry, blue/green and canary rollouts, and robust observability. I work primarily in Python and Java, with working knowledge of Go and C++ for performance-sensitive components, and practical experience with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Spark. I frequently bridge research and production and lead small cross-functional efforts to ship customer-facing ML features.\n\nRecent impact includes: designing real-time serving on EKS (FastAPI + gRPC) achieving p50 ~18 ms, p95 ~60 ms at 300–500 QPS with a 99.95% SLO and instant rollback via versioned endpoints; delivering batch scoring over 116M+ records/year with Glue (PySpark) and SageMaker Processing (~5–7M records/hour) plus Kafka pipelines for near-real-time updates; and optimizing inference via distillation and ONNX/TensorRT quantization to cut model memory ~65% and p95 latency ~35%, contributing to a +22% audit hit rate, 30% faster triage, and ~30% lower compute cost. I’ve also shipped zero-to-one LLM/RAG features and explored document OCR/CV and edge-ready packaging patterns where appropriate.\n\nI’m excited to help build resilient, scalable ML systems for Samsara—especially where real-time inference, MLOps rigor, and inference optimization meet. I’d welcome the chance to discuss how my experience can contribute to your team’s roadmap. Thank you for your time and consideration."
